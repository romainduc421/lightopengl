# hellOGL: modern OpenGL hello world

**Check [the wiki](https://github.com/ssloy/hellOGL/wiki) for a detailed description of the source code.**

The main idea of this repository is to show you how to create and initialize an OpenGL window; it is surprisingly difficult to have the very first code that compiles and works out of the box.
There are numerous repositories doing that, however (in my humble opinion) they miss the sweet spot: either they are hard to follow or the rendrings are ugly.

So here comes hellOGL:
